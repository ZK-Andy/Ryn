**Rich Yet Native.** A lightweight, cross-platform .NET framework for building desktop apps with web UIs.

Created & maintained by [Moh](https://github.com/Yupmoh)

Ryn gives .NET developers the Tauri experience without leaving C#. You write the UI in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the backend in C#, and ship a small NativeAOT binary that runs on the operating system's own webview.

## Why Ryn?

- **C# backend, web frontend:** write the UI in HTML/CSS/JS and the backend in C#, wired together by `[RynCommand]` source-generated IPC.
- **Lightweight:** uses the native OS webview (WebView2, WKWebView, WebKitGTK) instead of bundling Chromium.
- **NativeAOT:** small, self-contained binaries (~5 MB) with no runtime dependency.
- **Cross-platform:** Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Plugin system:** FileSystem, Dialog (native pickers), Clipboard, Shell (spawn/PTY streaming), Notification, Audio, Tray, and a signed Auto-updater.
- **Security model:** `ryn.json` capability scopes, deny-by-default.
- **Branded by default:** every window and bundled `.app`/installer ships with the Ryn icon, overridable per app.

## Why not an existing framework?

Before building Ryn I went through the existing options for desktop .NET with a web frontend. Each is good at what it does, but none gave me what I wanted: Tauri's ergonomics (native webviews, tiny binaries, a real plugin and capability model, a scaffolding CLI) without leaving C#.

- **[Tauri](https://tauri.app/):** the inspiration, and a great tool. The catch is the backend is Rust. Ryn exists so a .NET team can get the Tauri experience without rewriting their backend in another language.
- **[Photino](https://www.tryphotino.io/):** the closest .NET option, a thin wrapper over the same native webviews. It's deliberately minimal, with no plugin system, no capability-based security, no IPC source generator, and no CLI or project scaffolding. Ryn adds those on top of the same idea.
- **[Electron.NET](https://github.com/ElectronNET/Electron.NET) and [CefSharp](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp):** both bundle Chromium, so apps start around 100 MB and can't use NativeAOT. Ryn uses the OS's own webview (WebView2 / WKWebView / WebKitGTK) and ships ~4 MB AOT binaries.
- **.NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid:** Microsoft's official answer, but it pulls in the whole MAUI stack and a XAML host shell. It's heavy, mobile-first, and doesn't give you a plain "bring your own HTML/CSS/JS" frontend. Ryn is desktop-only and much lighter.
- **[Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/) and [Uno Platform](https://platform.uno/):** both are solid, but they're XAML frameworks that render their own controls rather than host a web frontend. If you want to use HTML/CSS/JS and the front-end tools you already know, that's a different model.

None of them gave me Tauri-style ergonomics on a native webview, with NativeAOT and a real security model, in C#. So I built Ryn.

## Status

**Alpha.** Ryn runs on **macOS** and **Windows**, both verified on real desktop apps. **Linux is the one platform whose GUI paths are not yet verified end-to-end** (it builds and unit-tests in CI; the window/tray/dialog code is written but unproven on a real desktop). Treat Linux as experimental.

### Platform support matrix

Legend: ✅ verified on a real app · 🟡 implemented, not yet GUI-verified · ⚪ not implemented

| Capability | macOS | Windows | Linux |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Window + WebView (saucer) | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 |
| IPC (`ryn://` scheme + local server) | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 |
| FileSystem plugin | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 |
| Dialogs / file pickers | ✅ (osascript) | ✅ (PowerShell+WinForms) | 🟡 (zenity/kdialog) |
| Clipboard (text) | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 (X11 via xclip, Wayland via wl-clipboard) |
| Clipboard (image) | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 |
| Notifications | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 (notify-send) |
| Audio playback | 🟡 | 🟡 | 🟡 |
| Shell / PTY | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 |
| Tray icon | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 (menu-only; no icon-click event) |
| Auto-updater (signed) | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 |
| NativeAOT publish | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 |

Native libraries are committed for `osx-arm64`; `win-x64`/`linux-x64` are built in CI. Help verifying the Linux GUI paths is welcome.

## Installation

### Option 1: NuGet Packages (recommended)

```bash
dotnet new console -n MyApp
cd MyApp
dotnet add package Ryn
```

The `Ryn` package bundles the whole framework in a single reference: `Ryn.Core`, `Ryn.Ipc` (with the `[RynCommand]` source generator), and `Ryn.Interop` (with the native webview libraries). The individual packages are also published if you'd rather reference them one at a time.

Add plugins as needed:

```bash
dotnet add package Ryn.Plugins.FileSystem
dotnet add package Ryn.Plugins.Dialog
dotnet add package Ryn.Plugins.Clipboard
dotnet add package Ryn.Plugins.Shell
dotnet add package Ryn.Plugins.Notification
dotnet add package Ryn.Plugins.Audio
dotnet add package Ryn.Plugins.Tray
dotnet add package Ryn.Plugins.Updater
```

Install the CLI tool:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g Ryn.Cli
```

### Option 2: Build from Source

Requires [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0), Git, and [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`).

**macOS:**
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Yupmoh/Ryn.git
cd Ryn
bash build/download-native.sh         # downloads prebuilt saucer libs
dotnet build Ryn.slnx
dotnet test Ryn.slnx
dotnet run --project samples/Showcase  # run the demo app
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Yupmoh/Ryn.git
cd Ryn
.\build\download-native.ps1           # downloads prebuilt saucer libs
dotnet build Ryn.slnx
dotnet test Ryn.slnx
dotnet run --project samples\Showcase
```

**Linux:**
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Yupmoh/Ryn.git
cd Ryn
sudo apt-get install libwebkitgtk-6.0-dev  # Ubuntu/Debian
bash build/download-native.sh
dotnet build Ryn.slnx
dotnet run --project samples/Showcase
```

To build native saucer libs from source (requires cmake + ninja):
```bash
bash build/build-native.sh
```

Check your environment with `ryn doctor` (or `dotnet run --project src/Ryn.Cli -- doctor` from source).

## Creating an App

### With the CLI

```bash
ryn new MyApp
cd MyApp
ryn dev
```

Or from source:
```bash
dotnet run --project src/Ryn.Cli -- new MyApp
cd MyApp
dotnet run
```

When run from within the Ryn source tree, `ryn new` generates project references. Otherwise it uses NuGet package references. The generated app includes a sample IPC command, a dark-themed HTML frontend, and a `ryn.json` capability file.

### Content serving

Ryn serves frontend files via the `ryn://` custom scheme, keeping everything same-origin with IPC (no CORS issues). There are three ways to provide content:

```csharp
// Option 1 (ContentDirectory): serve files from disk, recommended for dev
opts.ContentDirectory = Path.Combine(AppContext.BaseDirectory, "wwwroot");

// Option 2 (Html): inline HTML string
opts.Html = "<html>...</html>";

// Option 3 (Url): external URL, e.g. a Vite dev server
opts.Url = new Uri("http://localhost:5173");
```

With `ContentDirectory`, files are read from disk on each request, so changes show up on browser refresh without restarting the app.

### Windows requirements

On Windows, the entry point **must** use `[STAThread]` with a synchronous `Main` method. Without it, WebView2 initialization deadlocks silently. Ryn detects this at runtime and throws a clear error.

```csharp
public static class Program
{
    [System.STAThread]
    public static void Main()
    {
        var app = RynApplication.CreateBuilder()
            // ...
            .Build();

        app.Run(); // synchronous, blocks until the window closes
    }
}
```

Do **not** use `async Task Main` or top-level statements on Windows. Both default to MTA, which is incompatible with WebView2's COM requirements.

### How IPC works

Mark C# methods with `[RynCommand]`. The source generator builds the dispatch tables at compile time:

```csharp
using Ryn.Ipc;

public static class MyCommands
{
    [RynCommand]
    public static string Greet(string name) => $"Hello, {name}!";

    [RynCommand]
    public static int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;
}
```

Call them from JavaScript:

```javascript
const greeting = await window.__ryn.invoke('greet', { name: 'World' });
const sum = await window.__ryn.invoke('add', { a: 2, b: 3 });
```

Supported parameter/return types: `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `bool`, `string`, `JsonElement`, primitive arrays (`int[]`, `string[]`), nullable types (`int?`), and complex DTOs via `[RynJsonContext]`.

### Security with ryn.json

Control what the frontend can access:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "fs": {
      "allow": ["readTextFile", "readDir"],
      "scope": ["$APP_DATA"]
    },
    "shell": {
      "allow": ["execute"],
      "commands": ["echo", "git"]
    },
    "clipboard": true,
    "notification": true
  }
}
```

Missing `ryn.json` = allow all (dev mode). Present = deny by default. Empty `scope: []` or `commands: []` = explicit deny-all.

## Bundling for Distribution

```bash
dotnet run --project src/Ryn.Cli -- bundle
```

Options:
- `--aot`: enable NativeAOT publishing
- `--self-contained`: include the .NET runtime
- `--icon path/to/icon.png`: override the app icon (a PNG is auto-converted to `.icns` on macOS / `.ico` on Windows; an `.icns`/`.ico` is used as-is)
- `--sign "Developer ID"`: code sign (macOS)
- `--notarize`: submit for Apple notarization (macOS)
- `--version 1.0.0`: set the bundle version

When no icon is supplied (via `--icon` or `ryn.json` → `bundle.icon`), the bundle is branded with the Ryn default icon: a real dock icon (`AppIcon.icns`) on macOS, an `.ico` on Windows, and a hicolor PNG on Linux.

Output:
- **macOS**: `.app` bundle with Info.plist and `AppIcon.icns`
- **Windows**: Self-contained folder with executable + WiX `.wxs`
- **Linux**: AppDir structure (use [appimagetool](https://appimage.github.io/) to create an AppImage)
